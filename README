Important General Notes:
1. The matlab code is in relatively poor repair, while the c++ code is relatively well commented.
2. The c++ code is self-contained and is called via a system call from within the matlab code.  Therefore it can be extracted and used separately as required.
3. The c++ code identifies the floor sections within the parts of the image which has depth information.
4. The matlab code takes this label and applies the segmentation technique resulting in the full floor identification.  The matlab code is based on a modified version of the Geodesic Star Convexity code which is freely avaliable from: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/iseg/

Some notes on usage:
1. Please build the code in the cpp directory following the readme in that directory first.  Note you require a number of external libraries and that this code has only been tested on Ubuntu 11.10.

2. Data files are generally included as hard coded paths in mainRun.m. Other hard coded paths may exist.

3. Data file format:
	Data files are expected to be organised in a directory with the following structure:
		dataFolder
			- <dataDir>
			- <outputDir>
				- imgs
				- GTAll
	where <dataDir> is a directory containing the output files from a recording made by the RGBD-demo application.
	where <outputDir>/imgs is a folder which has been filled with the (renamed) images from the subfolders in <dataDir>.  This process of copying the images can be automated with the script preprocessData.sh (modify the hard coded paths first!).
	where GTAll is a directory the images to be evaluated (copied from the <outputDir>/imgs folder) <imgNuM>.png and a corresponding binary mask ground truth <imgNum>GT.bmp file.  The *.bmp files should be 1-bit indexed images.  Floor regions should be black and non-floor regions white.

4. vizResults.m and vizSeg.m can be used to visualize the results using overlays.
