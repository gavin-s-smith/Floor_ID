Important General Notes:
1. The matlab code is in relatively poor repair, while the c++ code is relatively well commented. A demo gui exists however.
2. The c++ code is self-contained and is called via a system call from within the matlab code.  Therefore it can be extracted and used separately as required.
3. The c++ code identifies the floor sections within the parts of the image which has depth information.
4. The matlab code takes this label and applies the segmentation technique resulting in the full floor identification.  The matlab code is based on a modified version of the Geodesic Star Convexity code which is freely avaliable from: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/iseg/

Some notes on usage:
1. Please build the code in the cpp directory following the readme in that directory first.  Note you require a number of external libraries and that this code has only been tested on Ubuntu 11.10.

Launch the demo: cd to the folder and then run demoGUI.m
